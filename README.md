# 🚀 Space Shooter (SFML)

A very basic space shooter made in C++ using SFML.  
This project is for learning and fun — don't expect polished visuals or deep gameplay.

## 🎮 Features

- Player can move and shoot
- Enemies spawn and move
- Collision detection between bullets and enemies
- Simple score tracker

> No pause, no menu, no game over, no health, no damage — just straight-up collisions.
